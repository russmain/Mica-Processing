# Mica-Processing
 Code for processing multiple multispectral images captured from UAV platforms. This code is based off of the Micasense RedEdge image processing tutorial. 
  
For the original tutorial go here: https://micasense.github.io/imageprocessing/MicaSense%20Image%20Processing%20Tutorial%201.html. 
This code is designed to correct multispectral photos captured with the Micasense RedEdge camera. The code corrects photos based on the reflectance from calibration panel, it also corrects for lens distortion. 
  
Disclaimer: most of this code came from the tutorial and code from user atedstone (https://github.com/atedstone/micasense_calibration).
